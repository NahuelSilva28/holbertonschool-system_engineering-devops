Description:
This is a basic web infrastructure that hosts a website accessible via www.foobar.com. The infrastructure lacks necessary security measures such as firewalls and SSL certificates to protect the server's network. Additionally, the server's resources, including CPU, RAM, and SSD, are shared among its components, such as the database and application server.

Specifics About This Infrastructure:

Server: The server refers to either the computer hardware or software responsible for providing services to other computers, commonly known as clients.

Domain Name: The domain name serves as a human-friendly alias for an IP address. For instance, <www.wikipedia.org> is easier to remember than its corresponding IP address, 91.198.174.192. The DNS (Domain Name System) maps the domain name alias to the associated IP address.

DNS Record for www.foobar.com: The DNS record used for <www.foobar.com> is an A record. This record type, checked using the dig command (e.g., dig <www.foobar.com>), stores a hostname along with its corresponding IPv4 address.

Web Server: The web server is a software or hardware component that accepts requests via HTTP or HTTPS and responds by providing the content of the requested resource or an error message.

Application Server: The application server is responsible for installing, operating, and hosting applications and related services for end users, IT services, and organizations. It facilitates the hosting and delivery of high-end consumer or business applications.

Database: The database manages a collection of organized information that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

Communication with the Client:
The server communicates with the client's computer (the user requesting the website) through the TCP/IP protocol suite over the internet network.

Issues With This Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure: The infrastructure has multiple single points of failure. For example, if the MySQL database server goes down, the entire website would become inaccessible.

Downtime During Maintenance: Performing maintenance checks on any component requires either temporarily putting them down or turning off the server. As there is only one server, such maintenance activities would result in website downtime.

Limited Scalability: Scaling the infrastructure becomes challenging due to the concentration of all required components on a single server. The server can quickly exhaust its resources or experience performance degradation when facing high incoming traffic.

To address these issues, it is recommended to implement measures such as redundancy, load balancing, and scalability in the infrastructure design.
