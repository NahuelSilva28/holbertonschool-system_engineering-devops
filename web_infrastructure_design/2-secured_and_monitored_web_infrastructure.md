Description:
This is a distributed web infrastructure with a load balancer that distributes traffic between a primary server and a replica server. The load balancer uses the Round Robin algorithm to evenly distribute requests. The primary server handles read and write operations, while the replica server focuses on read operations to reduce the primary server's workload. However, the infrastructure faces single points of failure, lacks security measures like SSL encryption and firewalls, and lacks a monitoring system. To improve the infrastructure, redundancy measures, security measures, and a monitoring system should be implemented.
